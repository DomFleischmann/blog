      <description>So this is my first blog post on my freshly made Blog, and what better way to start than going full meta and talk about how i built it.
Gotta go fast! One thing that I made priority when building this blog was making it pretty light and fast inspired by this article. What I took from it is that today&amp;rsquo;s websites are way to bloated and that prevents a lot of people with slow internet speeds of not being to enjoy them.</description>
