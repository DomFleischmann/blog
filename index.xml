      <description>After finishing my second year (of 4) of computer science I thought that I would like to work some time in the summer to earn some extra money and maybe work part time while studying after that. Little did I know that after a month I would end up with my first job in the software industry.
It all began with some simple job search, after I sent my first CVs to the typical student workplaces (Department stores, Cafeterias, Call Centers&amp;hellip;) I started noticing a lot of software job offerings.</description>

So on monday I finished the second week of Cousera&amp;rsquo;s Machine Learning course by Stanford University. First it started with some basic steps for installing Octave/Matlab, I obviously chose Octave over Matlab as it&amp;rsquo;s free software. After that there were some videos about Multivariate Linear Regression, it&amp;rsquo;s basically the same as linear regression so their wasn&amp;rsquo;t much difficulty, although in the final video Andrew started talking about polynomial regression and how we could use it for fitting better our models.</description>

      <description>For some time I wanted to learn the basics of machine learning. So after some research I found Cousera&amp;rsquo;s Machine Learning course by Stanford University and that it would start yesterday. So after reading all the great reviews about the course I enrolled and started it a week ago. The content is completely free, but if you pay 74â‚¬ you&amp;rsquo;ll get a certificate if you pass.
First week Andrew Ng is a great teacher who explains the material very well.</description>

      <title>How I built my Blog</title>

      <description>So this is my first blog post on my freshly made Blog, and what better way to start than going full meta and talk about how i built it.
Gotta go fast! One thing that I made priority when building this blog was making it pretty light and fast inspired by this article. What I took from it is that today&amp;rsquo;s websites are way to bloated and that prevents a lot of people with slow internet speeds of not being to enjoy them.</description>
