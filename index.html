So on monday I finished the second week of Cousera&rsquo;s Machine Learning course by Stanford University. First it started with some basic steps for installing Octave/Matlab, I obviously chose Octave over Matlab as it&rsquo;s free software. After that there were some videos about Multivariate Linear Regression, it&rsquo;s basically the same as linear regression so their wasn&rsquo;t much difficulty, although in the final video Andrew started talking about polynomial regression and how we could use it for fitting better our models.

			For some time I wanted to learn the basics of machine learning. So after some research I found Cousera&rsquo;s Machine Learning course by Stanford University and that it would start yesterday. So after reading all the great reviews about the course I enrolled and started it a week ago. The content is completely free, but if you pay 74â‚¬ you&rsquo;ll get a certificate if you pass.
First week Andrew Ng is a great teacher who explains the material very well.

			So this is my first blog post on my freshly made Blog, and what better way to start than going full meta and talk about how i built it.
Gotta go fast! One thing that I made priority when building this blog was making it pretty light and fast inspired by this article. What I took from it is that today&rsquo;s websites are way to bloated and that prevents a lot of people with slow internet speeds of not being to enjoy them.
