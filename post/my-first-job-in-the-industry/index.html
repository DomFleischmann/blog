			<h1>How I got my first job in the Software Industry without finishing even half of my studies</h1>

				<p>After finishing my second year (of 4) of computer science I thought
that I would like to work some time in the summer to earn some extra money and
maybe work part time while studying after that. Little did I know that after a
month I would end up with my first job in the software industry.</p>

<p>It all began with some simple job search, after I sent my first CVs to the
typical student workplaces (Department stores, Cafeterias, Call Centers&hellip;) I
started noticing a lot of software job offerings. So without thinking twice, I
just started including them on my CV spamming list. Little did I know that they
were a lot more interested in me than most of the other non IT related places.</p>

<p>Event though I started working at a call center after two weeks because it was
the first thing where they hired me, I started lining up several software
related job interviews. But to complicate my hiring even more, they couldn&rsquo;t
even hire me as intern as I still had to pass two subjects to arrive at half of
my university credits, necessary to start an internship.</p>

<p>Although this turned off some places, after two weeks at my call center job I
already had lined up two jobs where they were interested in me. One as an intern
(signing me up to some weird online course so they could hire me as such)
and the other as a full time employee. After 3 interviews in total I finally
took the full time job at SevenEighths as a Research Assistant. Obviously,
it isn&rsquo;t my dream job, but it is a great place to start and specially to learn.
On top of that I will probably continue in this job part time while I study.</p>

<p>The main point of this post is that even though you think you&rsquo;re still far
away of getting any job related to your studies there probably is a way to
start right now and getting experience. Just get out and try, there are a ton
of opportunities you only have to go for them!</p>

<p>For myself, I&rsquo;m just happy to being able to work in front of computers, do
some coding each day and not having to deal with angry customers at a call
center!</p>
