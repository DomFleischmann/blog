			<h1>Stanford&#39;s Machine Learning Course: Week 1</h1>

<p>For some time I wanted to learn the basics of machine learning. So after some research I found <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Cousera&rsquo;s Machine Learning course by Stanford University</a> and that the course would start yesterday. So after reading all the great reviews about the course I enrolled and started it a week ago. The course is completely free, but if you pay 74€ you&rsquo;ll get a certificate if you pass the course.</p>

<h3 id="first-week">First week</h3>

<p>Andrew Ng is a great teacher how explains the material very well. For each lesson you have 4 or 5 videos were Andrew explains and after some time the video will pause and you will have to answer a quiz, that way you maintain your attention and interiorize the content of the video. After watching the videos you&rsquo;ll have to answer a quiz of 5 questions getting 4 right (I got 100% on both on the first try).</p>

<p>The first week has 3 sections, an Introduction to the basics of machine learning like terminology and the basic idea and later the first algorithm: Linear regression with one variable. In the later of the first two sections you&rsquo;ll also learn about Gradient Descent and it&rsquo;s application for linear regression.</p>

<p>After that there is a third section that is optional, a basic Linear Algebra Review, for now I didn&rsquo;t take it because I took Linear Algebra last semester at university.</p>

<p>All in all I understood the content of the first week very well and am very excited for next week. After some weeks if I keep liking it I&rsquo;ll probably pay the 74€ for the certificate.</p>
